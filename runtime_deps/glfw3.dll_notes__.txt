The 'glfw3.dll' file is also required at runtime for dynamic linking.
It should be downloaded with the 'GLFW 3.3.2' lib, as noted below:

  [00_libs_notes__.txt]
    Download the following necessary files from the required libs
    into the '00_libs' folder as listed below:

        src\00_libs\glfw-3.3.2.bin.WIN64\include\GLFW
            glfw3.h
                                 ... ...\lib-vc2019
            glfw3dll.lib
            glfw3.dll

        ... ...

    The 'glfw3.dll' file above is not requrired at compilation time, but required at runtime.
    So it could be moved to be in the same path with the .exe file, after it's built.

Read the notes from the root folder for this project
before building for more details.
