Download the following necessary files from the required libs
into the '00_libs' folder as listed below:

    src\00_libs\glfw-3.3.2.bin.WIN64\include\GLFW
        glfw3.h
                             ... ...\lib-vc2019
        glfw3dll.lib
        glfw3.dll

    src\00_libs\gl3w\GL
        glcorearb.h
        gl3w.h
        gl3w.c

    src\00_libs\glm-0.9.9-a2\
        *

    src\00_libs\stb_image\
        stb_image.h

The 'glfw3.dll' file above is not requrired at compilation time, but required at runtime.
So it could be moved to be in the same path with the .exe file, after it's built.

Read the notes from the root folder for this project
before building for more details.
